DataStructures
==============

Collection of self-made data structures I'm making for myself as a thought experiment.  The purpose is so I can better understand the different kinds of data structures at my disposal as a programmer, as well as know the pros and cons of each.

The implementation of each data structure is based off what I am reading in the book "Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in C++" by Clifford A. Shaffer.  While much of the code does come from the book, I put my own twist on things and add some stuff of my own.


Data structures included so far:
--------------------------------

*Array-based List
*Singly Linked List
*Doubly Linked List
*Array-based Stack
*Linked Stack
